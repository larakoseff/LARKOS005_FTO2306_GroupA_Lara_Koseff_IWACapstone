üìö As a junior developer I have been tasked with making improvements to the JavaScript code of a social media platform developed for a startup called Book Connect. The original JavaScript code threw several errors and prevented the application from running. In my assessment, I noticed that many of the major errors were caused by incorrect syntax and the exclusion of or incorrect use of key methods, especially with regards to looping, accessing data- attributes within the HTML using the Document: querySelector() method, as well as the complete absence of event listeners. In addition, there were small but vital corrections that needed to be made to the script element in the HTML document, as well as ensuring that JavaScript modules were being properly utilised through exporting and importing data. 

After focussing on the above aspects and making many adjustments to the code, my work has ensured that:

‚úÖ The book list includes the author and title.

When the user accesses the front page they will be provided with a list of 36 books, with the option to ‚ÄúShow More‚Äù via a clickable button. This will extend the list by an additional 36 books until there are no more to show. The list, as the user story required, includes the author and title. 

‚úÖ The cover image is displayed in list and preview.

The user will be able to view a thumbnail image of each book cover in the initial book list as well as when they click on each individual entry to access the preview. 

‚úÖ The book summary is displayed in preview. 

A short summary of each book is provided in the clickable preview.  

‚úÖ The publishing date is displayed in preview. 

In addition the publishing date pulls through in brackets alongside the author‚Äôs name. 

‚úÖ The book list can be filtered by partial matches with the title.

When the user clicks on the search icon on the top right of the screen, it will pull up a search overlay. This will focus the option to search for a title, with a placeholder of ‚ÄúAny‚Äù. The tile can be searched in full, or partially, uppercase or lowercase. 

‚úÖ The book list can be filtered by author. 

In addition the user can either filter a search by selecting an author from the drop down menu or alternatively leave the initial option of searching ‚ÄúAll Authors‚Äù.  

‚úÖ The book list can be filtered by genre. 

As per the author search, the user can either filter a search by selecting a genre from the drop down menu or alternatively leave the initial option of searching ‚ÄúAll Genres‚Äù.  


If the search returns no result, the user will receive the message ‚ÄúNo results were found. Your filters may be too narrow.‚Äù


‚ùå The display can toggle between dark/light modes.

Unfortunately due to time limitations I did not achieve the final user story request, which is toggling between light and dark modes. This means that the setting button on the top right of the screen is not currently functional or clickable. However, I trust that this will be easily achievable now that the rest of the code has been debugged. 


I am happy to report that as it stands there are no current errors or bugs and the JavaScript code is functioning for the most part, as intended.
