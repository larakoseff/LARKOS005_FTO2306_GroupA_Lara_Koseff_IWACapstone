ðŸ“š As a junior developer I have been tasked with making improvements to the JavaScript code of a social media platform developed for a startup called Book Connect.  The original code threw several errors and prevented the application from running. 

After making several adjustments to the code, my work should ensure that:

The book list includes the author and title.
The cover image is displayed in list and preview.
The book summary is displayed in preview. 
The publishing date is displayed in preview. 
The book list can be filtered by partial matches with the title.
The book list can be filtered by author. 
The book list can be filtered by genre. 
The display can toggle between dark/light modes.
